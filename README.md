## 💭 What I learned



This is one of my first own projects that I created after udemy courses. I wanted to check what I had learned. The effect looks good (just my opinion) but I feel that it's still not enough, so I want to keep learning and developing. I'm leaving the project as it is so you can see what mistakes I made and be able to compare the code to see how much I've learned. Maybe you see some bugs you want to tell me about?
